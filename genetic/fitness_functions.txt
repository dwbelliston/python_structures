ALL_FIT = ( 5( (sum_SINGLE_FIT/count_SINGLE_FIT) /10) * (Collision * BusinessHours) + 1.5(FreeTime) + 2.5(ClassFree) + .5(FreeRooms) + .5(StudentsLeave) ) / 100

[Example Output is 0 - 100]

Collision = 0 if yes, 1 if no collisions
* Two courses cannot be scheduled in the same room at the same time.

BusinessHours = 0 if no, 1 if inside business hours
* Rooms can only be used from 8am-5pm each day.

FreeTime = 1 if minimal, 5 if decent, 10 if lots of free time
* When calculating free time, add 0.25 hours to the time of each course for students to move.

ClassFree = 1 if minimal, 5 if decent, 10 if lots of free time
* Maximize blocks of free time for each room.

FreeRooms = 1 if minimal, 5 if decent, 10 if lots of free rooms
* Minimize the overall number of rooms used.

StudentsLeave = 1 if lots of students leave, 5 if a few, 10 if none
* If you cannot find times for all courses in the building, minimize the total number of students who must leave the building for classrooms.

sum_SINGLE_FIT = sum of the individual fit functions
count_SINGLE_FIT = count of total assignments

--------------

SINGLE_FIT = 3(ConsistentTime) *  5(Capacity) * (StartTime) * 2(PreferredTime)

[Example Output is 0 - 100]

ConsistentTime = 1 if extreme, 5 if acceptable, 10 if the same
* Each course should be scheduled for its room at the same times each day it meets.

Capacity = 1 if 3 stdev away or overflow, 5 if 1-2 stdev away, 10 if exact
* Match the room size as close as possible to the number of students in each course.

StartTime = 0 if not starting on :00 or :30, 1 if same
* Courses can only start on the hour or half-hour.

PreferredTime = 1 if extreme, 5 if acceptable, 10 if the same
* Schedule courses during their preferred times of the day whenever possible.
