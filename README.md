### Python data structures and algorithms

## Recursion

## Arrays

## Linked Lists

## Best Practices:
- Always handle exceptions. Raise them instead of setting booleans. That enforces the user to handle them.


##
32-bit or 64-bit is how many bits are in a register

###Composition
'''Python
class newme(object):
  self.otherclass = OtherClass()
'''

###Inheritance
'''Python
class newme(OtherClass):
'''

Composition allows you to expose only the methods you want. (It could be accessed is some languages that dont have explicit private variables)

Generally Composition is better because you have more control. But if you truly are what you are inheriting, than that makes sense.


###Types

Statically: type is determined at compile time (java)

Dynamically: type is determined at run time (python)

Strong: cant change the type after it is typed

Weak: change type on fly
