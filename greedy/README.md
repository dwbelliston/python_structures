## Greedy Algorithms

1: Getting cash back at the bank
### What is the algorithm used for? Lets suppose a bank teller loves to give cash out to people. He always starts with the largest bills he can.

### How is it greedy? How does this impact the algorithm?
Its greedy because he also goes for the largest bill he can. In some cases this will work fine. Depending on the amount to give out and the bills available. An instance where it does not work out is if he was to tend $31 back. Suppose he had $25, $10, $5, and $1 bills. To get to $31 he would give out 1 $25, 1 $5 and 1 $1. This equals $31. Now, suppose the $5 bills are all gone. This would mean he would tend 1 $25 and 6 $1. That is 7 bills! But if he wasnt so greedy he could give out 3 $10 and 1 $1, which is 3 less bills.


2: Picking teams
### What is the algorithm used for? We have all been in a line on the playground, hoping we dont get picked last. The way kids pick teams are greedy.

### How is it greedy? How does this impact the algorithm?
A team captain will mostly just pick who he thinks the next best player is. He will do that at each stage. However, to put a good team together, you need to consider the team as a whole and how it will work together. If the best player is a ball hog and doesnt mesh well with the team, then the optimal pick may be someone who is less skilled, but can play a certain role on the team that is needed.
